Description: This package implements functions to retrieve the nearest genes
    around the peak, annotate genomic region of the peak, statstical methods
    for estimate the significance of overlap among ChIP peak data sets, and
    incorporate GEO database for user to compare the own dataset with those
    deposited in database. The comparison can be used to infer cooperative
    regulation and thus can be used to generate hypotheses. Several
    visualization functions are implemented to summarize the coverage of the
    peak experiment, average profile and heatmap of peaks binding to TSS
    regions, genomic annotation, distance to TSS, and overlap of peaks or
    genes.
